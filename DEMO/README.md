# GeneMiner-Test
This github repository is used to store test data  

`Dataset1`: Dataset 1 was mainly used to mine Angiosperms353. We ran GeneMiner and four open-source tools (HybPiper, aTRAM, Trinity, and SPAdes) using similar parameters.

`Dataset2`:Dataset 2 was used to mine plastid genes and some nuclear genes with high copy numbers. We ran GeneMiner and two open-source tools (HybPiper and NOVOPlasty) using similar parameters 

`Specific feature`:To explore the effects of sequencing depth, reference variation rate, sequencing error exclusion, weighted model, and bootstrap-verification on GeneMiner assembly results

`Demo`: A simulated dataset of `Arabidopsis thaliana` to help you quickly grasp the main usage of GeneMiner
