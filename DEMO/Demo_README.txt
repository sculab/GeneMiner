1. shallow_ref
This folder stores four common phylogenetic markers (ITS, matK, psbA, and rbcL) from Cnidium monnieri.

2. shallow_ref.gb
This is a genbank format reference from Cnidium monnieri

3. skimming_data1.fq.gz
Forward reads in FASTQ format (Cnidium monnieri, genome skimming data)

4. skimming_data2.fq.gz
Reverse reads in FASTQ format (Cnidium monnieri, genome skimming data)


5. ref_Arabidopsis_353
The directory to store Angiosperms353 sequences of the Arabidopsis genus is used as reference sequences for GeneMiner

6. Arabidopsis_thaliana_sim1.fq.gz
Forward reads in FASTQ format (Arabidopsis thaliana, transcriptome data)

7. Arabidopsis_thaliana_sim2.fq.gz
Reverse reads in FASTQ format (Arabidopsis thaliana, transcriptome data)


8. work.sh
The file records the commands to test the Demo.


Note: This is only a minor test, so we have appropriately omitted a portion of the raw sequencing data and reference sequences
